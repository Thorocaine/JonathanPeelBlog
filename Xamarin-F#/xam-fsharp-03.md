It is time to add some actual/more reaxtive things to this. I am going to try a few simple examples.
 - A search box that will list a few predefined options.
 - A counter that will increment every 10 seconds.
 - A +/- button that will modify a number.

## Copy the project
I am going to copy my `FXamRx` project, but I won't rename anything.
