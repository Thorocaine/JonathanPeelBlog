Next, I want to add [ReactiveUI](https://reactiveui.net/).

## Copy Project
I am making a copy of my project folder, and calling it FXamRx. I also open up Visual Studio, the solution, projects, and all namespaces to FXamRx.  
Then build and run everything, to make sure that nothing has been broken.

## Add ReactiveUI
Right click on the solution and select _Manage NuGet Pacgaes for Solution
